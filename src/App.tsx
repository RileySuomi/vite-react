                    I will be adding more text to this section to see how it looks. Okay,
                    I think this is enough text for now.

                    To important note : Dr. Gill said this in on the assignment itself - "
                    You should probably NOT include every detail of every analysis that you 
                    considered during the quarter -- focus on key results and telling a clear 
                    story grounded in the data. Your group has a key research question or two.
                    The report should be built around addressing the research questions in a 
                    clear and relatively concise manner. Start by thinking about the key message 
                    or story that you want to tell. Build the report around that story, firmly 
                    grounding your key conclusions in the data. Leave out extraneous analyses
                    that do not contribute to that story. " - Dr. Gill

                    So we should just focus on key things related to whatever our
                    research question is. Make it nice and professional but simple.

                    as far as naming the variables and what they mean.
